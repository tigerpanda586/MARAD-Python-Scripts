# MARAD-Python-Scripts
This includes python scripts intern Jessica Brown (06/2021 - 07/2021) worked on during her time at MARAD. These files aim to help those at MARAD easier make sense of Python 
through her experience. The data used are port data. This includes entrances (when vessels enter port) and clearances (when vessels exit port). The columns in the data are 
about the vessels such as weight, year built, previous locations, operators/owners of vessels, etc.
